### Introduction
Honey-Guardian is a multi-honeypot platform based on Docker, designed to emulate various network environments to capture and analyze cyberattacks. The platform integrates several honeypots, including Cowrie, Dionaea, Conpot, HoneyThing, and Glastopf, along with the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized log collection, analysis, and visualization.

### Features
- Emulates diverse network services, IoT devices, and ICS/SCADA systems.
- Deploys honeypots in isolated Docker containers for security and scalability.
- Uses the ELK stack for centralized log processing and real-time data visualization.
- Provides a user-friendly GUI for easy management and orchestration.
